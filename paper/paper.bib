  abstract = {This paper develops a formalism for the design of conserving time-integration schemes for Hamiltonian systems with symmetry. The main result is that, through the introduction of a discrete directional derivative, implicit second-order conserving schemes can be constructed for general systems which preserve the Hamiltonian along with a certain class of other first integrals arising from affine symmetries. Discrete Hamiltonian systems are introduced as formal abstractions of conserving schemes and are analyzed within the context of discrete dynamical systems; in particular, various symmetry and stability properties are investigated.},

This book is the outcome of the European Project "Geoplex" (FP5 IST-2001-34166) that studied and extended such system modeling and control methodologies. This unique book starts from the basic concept of port-based modeling, and extends it to port-Hamiltonian systems. This generic paradigm is applied to various physical domains, showing its power and unifying flexibility for real multi-domain systems.},

In this book the authors outline the principles of geometric integration and demonstrate how they can be applied to provide efficient numerical methods for simulating conservative models. Beginning from basic principles and continuing with discussions regarding the advantageous properties of such schemes, the book introduces methods for the N-body problem, systems with holonomic constraints, and rigid bodies. More advanced topics treated include high-order and variable stepsize methods, schemes for treating problems involving multiple time-scales, and applications to molecular dynamics and partial differential equations. The emphasis is on providing a unified theoretical framework as well as a practical guide for users. The inclusion of examples, background material and exercises enhance the usefulness of the book for self-instruction or as a text for a graduate course on the subject.},
